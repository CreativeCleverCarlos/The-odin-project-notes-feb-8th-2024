    <!--An SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) are a scalable image format. Meaning they can scale to any size and keep their quaity while also not increasing the filesize-->

    <!--They are really good for simple images, but not good for more complex or realistic ones-->

    <!--All in all, it looks like it could be handy for web design, but it's not really something that I find useful or interesting-->
